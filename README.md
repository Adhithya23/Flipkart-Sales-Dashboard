Which products are the most profitable?<br>
What are the most popular payment methods?<br>
How do sales and profits fluctuate throughout the year?<br>
What day of the week sees the highest number of orders?<br>

###  Goal of the Dashboard: 

To provide an interactive visual tool that enables users to:
Track and analyze sales performance over time.<br>
Identify top-performing product sub-categories.<br>
Understand customer behavior through payment mode and order day analysis.<br>
Uncover trends and patterns in monthly sales and profit.<br>
